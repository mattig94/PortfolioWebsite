				<p>You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. You're meant to have fun in life. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it.</p>

				<h2>Happy Text 2</h2>
				<p>Just let these leaves jump off the brush We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud.</p>

				<h2>Happy Text 3</h2>
				<p>Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Just make a decision and let it go.</p>

				<h2>Happy Text 4</h2>
				<p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.</p>

				<h2>Happy Text 5</h2>
				<p>Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Son of a gun.</p>

				<h2>Happy Text 6</h2>
				<p>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have to make these big decisions. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.</p>
